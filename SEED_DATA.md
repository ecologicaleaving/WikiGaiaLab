## Database Schema

The seed data is applied through migration files:

- `packages/database/src/migrations/004_seed_data.sql` - Main seed data
- `packages/database/src/migrations/006_enhanced_seed_data.sql` - Additional seed data

## Development Tips

### Testing Different User Roles

1. **Admin User**: Use `admin@wikigaialab.com` to test admin features
2. **Regular Users**: Use other email addresses to test user features
3. **Premium Users**: Bob Smith and David Wilson have premium access

### Resetting Seed Data

```bash
# Reset database and reapply all migrations with seed data
npm run db:reset

# Check current database status
npm run db:status

# Generate fresh TypeScript types
npm run db:generate
```

### Customizing Seed Data

To modify seed data:

1. Edit `packages/database/src/migrations/004_seed_data.sql`
2. Run `npm run db:reset` to apply changes
3. Or create a new migration file for additional seed data

### Troubleshooting

**Database connection issues:**
```bash
# Check if Supabase is running
supabase status

# Start Supabase if needed
supabase start
```

**Seed data not appearing:**
```bash
# Force reset database
supabase db reset

# Check migration status
supabase migration list
```

**Missing TypeScript types:**
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

## API Testing

With seed data, you can test these API endpoints:

- `GET /api/problems` - List problems
- `GET /api/categories` - List categories
- `POST /api/votes` - Vote on problems
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `GET /api/apps` - List apps

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This seed data is for development only!

- Never use seed data in production
- All passwords and keys are for local development
- Admin credentials are publicly known
- Database is reset on every `db:reset` command

## Contributing

To add new seed data:

1. Create a new migration file: `supabase migration new add_more_seed_data`
2. Add your SQL INSERT statements
3. Test with `npm run db:reset`
4. Update this documentation
