# Authentication Fix Test Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The authentication context was showing "authenticating" spinner and never stopping when users switched tabs and returned to the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Problematic Visibility Change Handler
- Completely disabled the visibility change handler that was causing infinite loading loops
- This handler was triggering unnecessary token refreshes when switching tabs

### 2. Simplified Auth State Change Handler
- Only show loading spinner for explicit SIGNED_OUT events
- Removed loading states for TOKEN_REFRESHED and other automatic events
- This prevents the spinner from showing during background token operations

### 3. Enhanced Loading Screen Logic
- Only show AuthLoadingScreen when there's no cached session
- Prevents showing loading screen when we have valid session data

### 4. Improved Session Management
- Added optional loading parameter to refreshSession function
- Background session refreshes don't trigger loading states
- Maintains session caching functionality

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Login**: Use Google OAuth to authenticate
3. **Navigate around**: Browse different pages while authenticated
4. **Switch tabs**: Open a new tab, go to a different website
5. **Return to app**: Switch back to the WikiGaiaLab tab
6. **Verify**: Should NOT see "authenticating" spinner
7. **Expected behavior**: App should work normally without loading states

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ "Verifying authentication" spinner appears when returning to tab
- ❌ Spinner never stops, causing infinite loading
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Fix:
- ✅ No authentication spinner when switching tabs
- ✅ Instant session restoration from cache
- ✅ Smooth user experience
- ✅ Background token management without UI disruption

## Key Technical Changes

1. **Disabled visibility change handler** (lines 331-352 in AuthContext.tsx)
2. **Simplified loading states** in auth state change handler (lines 296-298)
3. **Enhanced loading screen condition** (line 375)
4. **Optional loading parameter** in refreshSession function (line 158)

## Fallback Behavior

- Session caching still works for fast restoration
- Token refresh happens automatically in background
- Error handling remains intact
- Manual refresh still available if needed

The fix prioritizes user experience by eliminating unnecessary loading states while maintaining all security and functionality.
