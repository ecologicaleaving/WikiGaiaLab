# Loading Issue Diagnostic

## Current Status
- ✅ Server running successfully on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Environment validation fixed
- ⚠️ User reports "loading, loading, loading"

## Possible Causes

### 1. Authentication Context
- **Status**: Fixed (disabled visibility change handler)
- **Check**: Should only show loading during initial auth check
- **Fix**: Loading screen only shows if `state.loading && !state.user && !state.error && !state.session`

### 2. API Endpoints
- **Status**: Previously fixed
- **Check**: Look for failed API calls in Network tab
- **Common issues**: 
  - `/api/recommendations/*` endpoints
  - `/api/auth/*` endpoints
  - `/api/monitoring/*` endpoints

### 3. React Components
- **Status**: Unknown
- **Check**: Component-level loading states
- **Common issues**:
  - useEffect hooks with missing dependencies
  - Infinite re-renders
  - Missing error boundaries

### 4. Network Issues
- **Status**: Unknown
- **Check**: Slow or failing network requests
- **Common issues**:
  - Slow Supabase connections
  - Failed external API calls
  - Timeout issues

## Debugging Steps

### Browser Developer Tools
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check **Console** tab for errors
4. Check **Network** tab for failed requests
5. Check **Performance** tab for slow operations

### Loading Screen Analysis
1. **Where**: What page/component shows loading?
2. **When**: At page load, after authentication, during navigation?
3. **Duration**: How long does it stay loading?
4. **State**: Does it eventually load or stay forever?

### Quick Fixes to Try
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Clear cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies
3. **Incognito mode**: Try in private/incognito window
4. **Different browser**: Test in different browser

## Expected Behavior
- Initial page load should be under 3 seconds
- Authentication should be instant with cached session
- No infinite loading states
- Clean console output

## Next Steps
Based on diagnostic results, implement targeted fixes for the specific loading issue identified.
