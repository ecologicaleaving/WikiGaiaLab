# Epic 3: Voting System

## Epic Summary
Implement the core voting mechanism that allows users to vote on problems, track voting history, and trigger development workflows when problems reach vote thresholds.

## Epic Goals
- Enable one-time voting per user per problem
- Track voting history and user preferences
- Implement real-time vote counting and display
- Create notification system for vote milestones
- Establish workflow for problem development triggers

## Functional Requirements Covered
- **FR4**: One-time voting per user per problem with database tracking
- **FR5**: Automated email notifications at vote thresholds (50, 75, 100)
- **FR6**: Admin notifications when problems reach 100 votes
- **FR8**: Vote tracking for premium access to future solutions
- **FR12**: Admin override for developing sub-100 vote problems
