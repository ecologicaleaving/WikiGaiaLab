# Epic 2: Problem-Vote Core Loop

## Epic Summary
Implement the core problem-vote interaction cycle that forms the heart of the WikiGaiaLab platform, enabling users to propose problems, browse existing problems, and vote on them in a seamless, engaging experience.

## Epic Goals
- Create complete problem proposal and display system
- Implement core voting mechanism with real-time updates
- Enable social sharing for viral growth
- Establish the fundamental user interaction loop
- Ensure smooth, responsive problem-vote experience

## Functional Requirements Covered
- **FR2**: Problem proposal form with title, description, and category
- **FR3**: Problem display as cards with real-time vote counters
- **FR4**: One-time voting per user per problem with database tracking
- **FR7**: Social media sharing for problems (Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter)

## Technical Dependencies
- Database schema with problems, votes, categories tables (Epic 1)
- Authentication system for user identification (Epic 1)
- Real-time database subscriptions (Supabase)
- Social media API integrations
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

## Success Metrics
- Problem proposal completion rate > 85%
- Vote interaction completion rate > 90%
- Real-time update latency < 200ms
- Social sharing click-through rate > 5%
- User retention after first vote > 60%
- Problem discovery rate (users finding relevant problems) > 70%

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Real-time voting performance under load
  - **Mitigation**: Optimized database queries, caching, WebSocket scaling
- **Risk**: Social sharing not driving engagement
  - **Mitigation**: A/B testing of sharing messages, incentive mechanisms
- **Risk**: Problem quality and spam
  - **Mitigation**: Content validation, moderation queues, community reporting

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for vote updates
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Cache vote counts to reduce database load
- Use debouncing for rapid vote clicks
- Implement proper error boundaries for failed operations
