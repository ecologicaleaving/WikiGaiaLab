# Story 3.3: Content Management & Pre-population

## Story Overview
**Epic**: Community Engagement  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 13 story points  
**Status**: In Development  

### User Story
As a platform admin, I need content management tools and initial content pre-population so that the platform launches with diverse, high-quality problems and maintains content quality over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC3.3.1: Initial Content Pre-population
- **GIVEN** the database is empty
- **WHEN** the admin runs the content seeding process
- **THEN** the platform is populated with 20-30 diverse, high-quality problems across all categories
- **AND** each problem has realistic vote counts (5-50 votes)
- **AND** problems span different complexity levels and domains

### AC3.3.2: Admin Content Dashboard
- **GIVEN** an authenticated admin user
- **WHEN** they access `/admin/content`
- **THEN** they see a comprehensive dashboard with:
  - Problem moderation queue (pending approvals)
  - Content statistics (total problems, votes, categories)
  - Recent activity feed
  - Content quality metrics

### AC3.3.3: Problem Moderation Interface
- **GIVEN** pending problems in the moderation queue
- **WHEN** admin reviews a problem
- **THEN** they can:
  - Approve the problem (moves to "Proposed" status)
  - Request changes with specific feedback
  - Reject with reason
  - Edit title/description for quality improvements
  - Assign to different category

### AC3.3.4: Bulk Content Operations
- **GIVEN** multiple problems selected
- **WHEN** admin performs bulk actions
- **THEN** they can:
  - Approve multiple problems at once
  - Bulk reject with common reason
  - Bulk category reassignment
  - Export problem data to CSV/JSON

### AC3.3.5: Content Quality Validation
- **GIVEN** any new problem submission
- **WHEN** it enters the system
- **THEN** it's automatically checked for:
  - Duplicate detection (similar titles/descriptions)
  - Language appropriateness (profanity filter)
  - Minimum quality standards (length, clarity)
  - Category relevance scoring

### AC3.3.6: Featured Content Curation
- **GIVEN** approved problems in the system
- **WHEN** admin selects high-quality problems
- **THEN** they can:
  - Mark problems as "Featured" for homepage prominence
  - Set featured duration (1 week, 1 month, permanent)
  - Create themed collections (e.g., "Environmental Solutions")
  - Schedule featured content rotation

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Add moderation fields to problems table
ALTER TABLE problems ADD COLUMN moderation_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE problems ADD COLUMN moderation_notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE problems ADD COLUMN moderated_by UUID REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE problems ADD COLUMN moderated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE problems ADD COLUMN is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE problems ADD COLUMN featured_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Content collections table
CREATE TABLE content_collections (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Junction table for problems in collections
CREATE TABLE collection_problems (
    collection_id UUID REFERENCES content_collections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    problem_id UUID REFERENCES problems(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    added_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (collection_id, problem_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/content/dashboard` - Content overview statistics
- `GET /api/admin/content/moderation` - Pending problems queue
- `PUT /api/admin/content/problems/:id/moderate` - Approve/reject problem
- `POST /api/admin/content/problems/bulk-action` - Bulk operations
- `GET /api/admin/content/featured` - Featured content management
- `PUT /api/admin/content/problems/:id/featured` - Toggle featured status

### Content Seeding Data
Create diverse, realistic problems across categories:

**Tecnologia (5-7 problems)**
- AI tool integration challenges
- Mobile app performance issues
- Data privacy concerns
- Cloud migration difficulties

**Ambiente (5-7 problems)**
- Local recycling optimization
- Urban air quality monitoring
- Sustainable transport solutions
- Energy consumption tracking

**Sociale (5-7 problems)**
- Community engagement platforms
- Volunteer coordination systems
- Local event organization
- Neighborhood communication

**Economia (5-7 problems)**
- Small business financial tools
- Local marketplace platforms
- Freelancer collaboration systems
- Budget tracking solutions

**Salute (5-7 problems)**
- Mental health support apps
- Fitness tracking integration
- Medication reminder systems
- Health data aggregation

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Database & Seeding (3 days)
1. **Migration**: Extend problems table with moderation fields
2. **Seeding Script**: Create comprehensive problem dataset
3. **Collections Schema**: Implement content collections system

### Phase 2: Admin Dashboard (4 days)  
1. **Dashboard Layout**: Admin content overview page
2. **Statistics API**: Content metrics and analytics
3. **Activity Feed**: Real-time content activity tracking

### Phase 3: Moderation Interface (4 days)
1. **Review Queue**: Problem moderation interface
2. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and batch actions
3. **Quality Validation**: Automated content checking

### Phase 4: Featured Content (2 days)
1. **Featured UI**: Admin interface for content curation
2. **Homepage Integration**: Display featured problems
3. **Scheduling**: Time-based featured content rotation

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Content seeding functions
- Moderation status transitions
- Quality validation algorithms
- Bulk operation logic

### Integration Tests
- Admin authentication/authorization
- Database transaction integrity
- API endpoint functionality
- Featured content display

### Performance Tests
- Large dataset seeding performance
- Dashboard loading with thousands of problems
- Bulk operation efficiency
- Search performance with pre-populated content

## Security Considerations

### Admin Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Admin-only route protection
- Action logging and audit trails
- Session management for admin users

### Content Security
- Input sanitization for admin edits
- XSS prevention in admin interfaces
- SQL injection protection
- File upload security (if applicable)

## Success Metrics

### Content Quality
- Problem approval rate > 85%
- Duplicate detection accuracy > 95%

- Content diversity across categories (min 5 per category)

### Admin Efficiency
- Average moderation time < 2 minutes per problem
- Bulk operation success rate > 99%
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
- Admin task completion rate > 90%

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Database migrations executed successfully
- [ ] 25+ diverse problems seeded across all categories
- [ ] Admin dashboard displays content statistics
- [ ] Moderation queue allows approve/reject/edit actions
- [ ] Bulk operations work for multiple problems
- [ ] Featured content system functional
- [ ] Quality validation prevents low-quality submissions
- [ ] All API endpoints secured with admin auth
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance meets specified metrics
- [ ] Documentation updated with admin procedures

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Poor quality seeded content affects user perception
**Mitigation**: Curate realistic, well-written problems with peer review

**Risk**: Admin interface complexity impacts usability  
**Mitigation**: Iterative UI testing with actual admin users

**Risk**: Performance degradation with large content volumes
**Mitigation**: Implement pagination, indexing, and query optimization
