## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**
No previous story - this is the foundation story.

### **Data Models**
*No specific data models required for this setup story* - Focus is on infrastructure preparation.
[Source: PRD Epic 1 - Foundation story precedes database implementation]

### **API Specifications**
*No API specifications needed for this setup story* - API structure will be established in subsequent stories.
[Source: architecture.md - API Routes to be implemented after foundation]

### **Component Specifications**
*No UI components required for this setup story* - Component architecture will be established post-setup.
[Source: architecture.md#Component-Architecture - Components follow after project initialization]

### **File Locations**
Based on the architecture document, files should be created in the following structure:
- **Root level**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`, `.env.example`, `README.md`
- **Apps directory**: `apps/web/` (main Next.js application)
- **Packages directory**: `packages/database/`, `packages/shared/`, `packages/config/`
- **Configuration files**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configs in `packages/config/`
- **Environment files**: `.env.local.example` in `apps/web/`
[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

### **Testing Requirements**

## Implementation Guidance

### **Development Environment Setup**
1. **Prerequisites Check**:
   - Verify Node.js 20+ installation
   - Install `pnpm` globally: `npm install -g pnpm`
   - Verify Git installation and configuration

2. **Project Initialization Sequence**:
   ```bash
   # Create project directory
   mkdir wikigaialab && cd wikigaialab
   
   # Initialize git repository
   git init
   
   # Create monorepo structure
   mkdir -p apps/web packages/{database,shared,config}
   
   # Initialize pnpm workspace
   pnpm init
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Create `.env.example` files with required variables
   - Document all environment variables with descriptions
   - Set up environment validation using zod or joi
   - Configure separate environments for development, staging, production

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**
- [ ] All package.json scripts work correctly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-17
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: The project setup demonstrates a solid foundation with proper monorepo structure and comprehensive configuration files. However, there are several critical issues that prevent production readiness:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: The project is missing essential `node_modules` installations, preventing proper execution of lint and type-check scripts
2. **Incomplete Package Structure**: Several packages are missing proper implementations and tsconfig.json files
3. **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables are properly structured but missing validation
4. **Testing Setup**: Jest configuration is present but lacks proper setup files and test structure

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/jest.config.js`
- **Change**: Fixed duplicate setupFiles configuration and updated testEnvironment
- **Why**: Having both setupFiles and setupFilesAfterEnv with same file causes conflicts
- **How**: Removed duplicate setupFiles entry, kept setupFilesAfterEnv, set proper jsdom environment

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/jest.setup.js`
- **Change**: Created comprehensive Jest setup with proper mocks
- **Why**: Jest configuration referenced missing setup file, preventing tests from running
- **How**: Added React Testing Library setup, Supabase mocks, Next.js mocks, and global utilities

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/apps/web/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- **Change**: Created proper Supabase client configuration with TypeScript types
- **Why**: Supabase client should be in the web app with proper error handling and typing

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/packages/shared/src/env.ts`
- **Change**: Updated environment validation to handle optional variables properly
- **Why**: Development environment shouldn't require all production variables
- **How**: Made authentication, payments, and AI services optional in development

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/apps/web/next.config.js`
- **Change**: Improved CORS configuration security
- **Why**: Permissive CORS settings (*) pose security risks

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/packages/ui/tsconfig.json`
- **Change**: Created proper TypeScript configuration for UI package
- **Why**: Missing tsconfig.json prevented TypeScript compilation
- **How**: Added React JSX support, proper extends, and build configuration

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/apps/web/tests/`
- **Change**: Created comprehensive test directory structure
- **Why**: Testing infrastructure was incomplete despite Jest configuration
- **How**: Added unit, integration, and e2e test directories with sample tests

**File**: `/Users/davidecrescentini/00-Progetti/000-WikiGaiaLab/apps/web/playwright.config.ts`
- **Change**: Created proper Playwright configuration for e2e testing

### Security Review

**Issues Found:**
1. **Environment Variables**: Missing validation and proper typing
2. **CORS Configuration**: Next.js config has permissive CORS settings that should be restricted
3. **Dependencies**: Some packages may have security vulnerabilities (needs audit)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement environment variable validation with zod
- Restrict CORS origins to specific domains
- Run `pnpm audit` and fix vulnerabilities
- Add proper error handling for database connections

### Performance Considerations

**Issues Found:**
1. **Bundle Size**: No optimization for production builds
2. **Image Optimization**: Basic Next.js image config but missing optimization settings
3. **Database Connections**: No connection pooling configuration

**Recommendations:**
- Configure bundle analyzer
- Implement proper image optimization strategy
- Add database connection pooling
- Set up performance monitoring

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Dependencies Installation**: Project cannot run without installing dependencies
2. **Missing Core Files**: Several referenced files don't exist (jest.setup.js, proper lib structure)
3. **Environment Setup**: Missing environment validation and proper client setup
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Test setup is incomplete despite configuration being present
