# Story 2.4: Enhanced Problem Detail View

## Story Overview
As a community member, I want to view detailed problem information with rich context and navigation, so that I can fully understand problems before voting and easily discover related content.

## Epic
Epic 2: Problem-Vote Core Loop

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Rich Problem Information Display
- **Given** a user navigates to a problem detail page
- **When** they view the problem
- **Then** they should see:
  - Full problem title and complete description with proper formatting
  - Proposer information with avatar and name
  - Category badge with clear visual styling
  - Creation and last updated dates
  - Current problem status (Proposed, In Development, Completed)
  - Complete vote count with voting interface
  - Problem metadata in an organized, scannable format

### AC2: Enhanced Problem Metadata
- **Given** a problem detail page is displayed
- **When** users view the metadata section
- **Then** they should see:
  - Proposer profile link (clickable name/avatar)
  - Problem creation timestamp with relative time (e.g., "3 days ago")
  - Last updated timestamp if different from creation
  - Category with description tooltip
  - Problem status with status-specific icons and colors
  - Vote milestone indicators (e.g., "50 votes reached!")

### AC3: Related Problems Suggestions
- **Given** a user is viewing a problem detail
- **When** they scroll to the related content section
- **Then** they should see:
  - 3-6 related problems from the same category
  - Problems with similar vote counts or engagement
  - Mix of recent and popular problems
  - Each suggestion shows title, vote count, and category
  - Click to navigate to related problem detail
  - "View more in [Category]" link to filtered list

### AC4: Breadcrumb Navigation
- **Given** a user is on a problem detail page
- **When** they look at the navigation
- **Then** they should see:
  - Breadcrumb trail: Home > Problems > [Category] > Problem Title
  - Clickable breadcrumb segments for easy navigation
  - Current page highlighted in breadcrumb
  - Mobile-friendly breadcrumb with truncation if needed
  - Back button option for browser-like navigation

### AC5: Rich Text Description Display
- **Given** a problem has a detailed description
- **When** displayed on the detail page
- **Then** the system should:
  - Preserve line breaks and paragraph formatting
  - Support basic markdown rendering (bold, italic, lists)
  - Handle long descriptions with proper spacing
  - Make URLs clickable and open in new tabs
  - Sanitize content to prevent XSS attacks
  - Show description in a readable, well-formatted layout

### AC6: Enhanced Voting Integration
- **Given** the voting system from Story 2.3
- **When** displayed on the problem detail page
- **Then** it should include:
  - Prominent vote button with current user vote state
  - Large, clear vote count display
  - Vote milestone celebrations (visual indicators at 25, 50, 100 votes)
  - Recent voting activity summary ("5 votes in the last hour")
  - Voting trends visualization (simple chart or indicator)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Enhancements

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1: Problem Proposal System ✅ (problems to display)
- Story 2.2: Problem Discovery & Listing ✅ (navigation integration)
- Story 2.3: Democratic Voting Implementation ✅ (voting interface)
- Existing database schema ✅ (problems, categories, users, votes)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Problem detail page displays comprehensive information
