# Story 2.1: Problem Proposal System

## Story Overview
As a community member, I want to propose new problems for the community to solve, so that I can contribute ideas and initiate collaborative problem-solving processes.

## Epic
Epic 2: Problem-Vote Core Loop

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Problem Submission Form
- **Given** an authenticated user navigates to `/problems/new`
- **When** they access the problem proposal form
- **Then** they should see a clean, intuitive form with:
  - Title field (5-100 characters, required)
  - Description field (10-1000 characters, required, markdown support)
  - Category selection dropdown (populated from database)
  - Clear validation messages
  - Submit button with loading state

### AC2: Form Validation & UX
- **Given** a user fills out the problem proposal form
- **When** they submit invalid data
- **Then** the system should:
  - Display real-time validation messages
  - Prevent submission with clear error indicators
  - Maintain user input during validation
  - Show character count for title and description

### AC3: Successful Problem Creation
- **Given** a user submits valid problem data
- **When** the form is processed successfully
- **Then** the system should:
  - Create a new problem record in the database
  - Automatically add the proposer's vote (vote_count = 1)
  - Update user's total_problems_proposed count
  - Redirect to the newly created problem detail page
  - Display a success notification

### AC4: Auto-Vote Mechanism
- **Given** a user successfully creates a problem
- **When** the problem is saved to the database
- **Then** the system should:
  - Automatically create a vote record for the proposer
  - Set initial vote_count to 1
  - Record the vote in the votes table
  - Ensure the database trigger handles vote counting

### AC5: Error Handling
- **Given** an error occurs during problem submission
- **When** the API request fails
- **Then** the system should:
  - Display a user-friendly error message
  - Preserve user input in the form
  - Provide retry option
  - Log detailed error information for debugging

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- `/apps/web/src/app/problems/new/page.tsx` - Main form page
- Form components using React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Category selector with database integration
- Markdown preview for description field
- Toast notifications for success/error states

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/problems` - Create new problem endpoint
- Validate user authentication
- Process form data with server-side validation
- Handle database operations and error cases

### Database Operations
- Insert new problem record
- Create associated vote record for proposer
- Update user statistics (total_problems_proposed)
- Utilize existing database triggers for vote counting

### Validation Schema
- Extend existing validation schemas in `packages/database/src/validation/schemas.ts`
- Title: 5-100 characters, required
- Description: 10-1000 characters, required
- Category: Valid UUID from categories table
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs

## Dependencies
- Authentication system (Epic 1) ✅
- Database schema (problems, votes, categories) ✅
- Navigation structure (/problems/new link) ✅
- Categories data in database ✅

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Problem proposal form is fully functional
- [ ] All validation rules are implemented and tested
- [ ] Auto-vote mechanism works correctly
- [ ] User can successfully create and view new problems
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] Form provides excellent user experience
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and standards
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Notes
- This story implements the primary user entry point for the problem-solving workflow
- Success here directly impacts user onboarding and platform adoption
- Form UX should be optimized for mobile devices
- Consider implementing draft save functionality for longer descriptions
