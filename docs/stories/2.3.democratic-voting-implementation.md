# Story 2.3: Democratic Voting Implementation

## Story Overview
As a community member, I want to vote on problems that interest me, so that the most important challenges can be prioritized and receive development resources based on community consensus.

## Epic
Epic 2: Problem-Vote Core Loop

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: One-Click Voting System
- **Given** an authenticated user views a problem (detail page or list card)
- **When** they click the vote button
- **Then** the system should:
  - Add their vote to the database (if not already voted)
  - Remove their vote from the database (if already voted - toggle behavior)
  - Update the vote count immediately with optimistic UI
  - Show visual feedback (heart fill animation, color change)
  - Display confirmation toast message
  - Handle concurrent votes gracefully

### AC2: Vote State Management
- **Given** a user has voting interactions
- **When** they view problems
- **Then** the system should:
  - Show whether they have already voted (filled vs outlined heart)
  - Display current vote count accurately
  - Prevent double-voting through database constraints
  - Sync vote state across all problem views (list, detail)
  - Handle authentication requirement with clear messaging

### AC3: Real-time Vote Updates
- **Given** multiple users are voting simultaneously
- **When** vote counts change
- **Then** the system should:
  - Update vote counts in real-time for all users
  - Use optimistic updates for immediate feedback
  - Revert on API failure with error message
  - Maintain consistency across problem list and detail views
  - Handle network failures gracefully

### AC4: Vote Count Display
- **Given** problems have received votes
- **When** displayed to users
- **Then** the system should:
  - Show accurate vote counts on problem cards
  - Display vote counts on problem detail pages
  - Format large numbers appropriately (1K, 1.2K, etc.)
  - Sort problems by vote count when requested
  - Update proposer vote statistics

### AC5: Voting Restrictions and Validation
- **Given** various user states and scenarios
- **When** voting is attempted
- **Then** the system should:
  - Require user authentication for voting
  - Prevent self-voting (proposer cannot vote on own problems)
  - Enforce one-vote-per-user-per-problem constraint
  - Handle edge cases (deleted problems, disabled users)
  - Provide clear error messages for all restrictions

### AC6: Analytics and User Feedback
- **Given** users interact with the voting system
- **When** they vote or view vote-related data
- **Then** the system should:
  - Track user voting behavior for analytics
  - Update user's total_votes_cast statistics
  - Provide visual feedback for voting actions
  - Show voting trends and popular problems
  - Enable vote history viewing (future enhancement placeholder)

## Technical Requirements

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/problems/[id]/vote` - Toggle vote for specific problem
- `GET /api/problems/[id]/vote-status` - Check user's vote status
- `GET /api/user/votes` - User's voting history (future)

### Database Operations
- Insert/delete vote records in votes table
- Update vote_count in problems table (via triggers)
- Update total_votes_cast in users table
- Maintain data consistency with transactions

### Frontend Components
- Enhanced vote button component with animations
- Vote state management with React hooks
- Optimistic UI updates with error handling
- Real-time synchronization between views

### Real-time Features
- Vote count updates using Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Optimistic UI with rollback on failure
- Cross-component state synchronization
- Network resilience and retry logic

### Security and Validation
- Server-side vote validation and constraints
- Rate limiting for vote endpoints
- Authentication checks on all voting operations
- SQL injection prevention in vote queries

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1: Problem Proposal System ✅ (problems to vote on)
- Story 2.2: Problem Discovery & Listing ✅ (vote buttons ready)
- Authentication system ✅ (user identification)
- Database triggers ✅ (auto-vote on problem creation)
- Real-time infrastructure ✅ (Supabase subscriptions)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can vote/unvote on problems with single click
- [ ] Vote state is accurately tracked and displayed
- [ ] Real-time vote count updates work across all views
- [ ] All voting restrictions properly enforced
- [ ] Optimistic UI provides immediate feedback
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases and network issues
- [ ] Vote statistics update correctly for users and problems
- [ ] Performance is optimal even with high voting activity
- [ ] Security measures prevent vote manipulation
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and TypeScript standards

## Implementation Notes
- Leverage existing database triggers for vote counting
- Use Supabase real-time for live vote updates
- Implement optimistic UI for instant user feedback
- Self-voting prevention already handled by database triggers
- Vote button animations enhance user engagement
- Consider rate limiting to prevent spam voting

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Vote history and analytics dashboard
- Trending problems based on voting velocity
- Vote notification system for problem proposers
- Advanced voting algorithms (weighted, time-decay)
- Vote-based problem recommendation engine
