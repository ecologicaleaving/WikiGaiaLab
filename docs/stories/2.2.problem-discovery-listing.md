# Story 2.2: Problem Discovery & Listing

## Story Overview
As a community member, I want to discover and browse problems proposed by others, so that I can find interesting challenges to vote on and engage with the community.

## Epic
Epic 2: Problem-Vote Core Loop

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Problems List Page
- **Given** a user navigates to `/problems`
- **When** they access the problems list page
- **Then** they should see:
  - Grid/list layout of problem cards
  - Problem title, description preview (150 chars), vote count
  - Proposer name and avatar
  - Category badge and creation date
  - Current status indicator
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### AC2: Filtering and Search
- **Given** a user is on the problems list page
- **When** they want to filter or search problems
- **Then** they should be able to:
  - Filter by category (dropdown with all active categories)
  - Filter by status (Proposed, In Development, Completed)
  - Search by title/description (real-time search)
  - Clear all filters with one click
  - See filter counts (e.g., "5 problems in Technology")

### AC3: Sorting Options
- **Given** a user wants to organize the problems list
- **When** they select sorting options
- **Then** they should be able to sort by:
  - Newest first (default)
  - Most voted (trending)
  - Oldest first
  - Alphabetical (A-Z)
  - Visual indication of current sort method

### AC4: Pagination and Performance
- **Given** there are many problems in the database
- **When** the user browses the list
- **Then** the system should:
  - Load 20 problems per page by default
  - Provide pagination controls (Previous/Next, page numbers)
  - Show loading states during fetch operations
  - Display total count and current page info
  - Maintain URL params for bookmarkable filtered views

### AC5: Problem Card Interactions
- **Given** a user sees a problem card
- **When** they interact with it
- **Then** they should be able to:
  - Click anywhere on card to view full problem details
  - Quick vote directly from the card (with animation)
  - See vote count update in real-time
  - View proposer profile (future feature placeholder)
  - Share problem link (future feature placeholder)

### AC6: Empty States and Loading
- **Given** various data states
- **When** the user experiences them
- **Then** they should see:
  - Loading skeleton cards during initial load
  - "No problems found" message with helpful suggestions
  - "No results" state for filtered searches with clear filters option
  - Error state with retry option if API fails

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- `/apps/web/src/app/problems/page.tsx` - Main problems list page
- Problem card component with vote button
- Filter/search component with category dropdown
- Pagination component with page controls
- Loading skeleton components

### API Enhancements
- Extend existing `GET /api/problems` with:
  - Category filtering support
  - Status filtering support
  - Text search functionality
  - Proper pagination metadata
  - Sort parameter handling

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2-3 cols tablet, 3-4 cols desktop)
- Search debouncing (300ms) for performance
- Filter state persistence in URL params
- Optimistic UI updates for voting
- Smooth loading transitions

### Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination to limit API payload
- Use React.memo for problem cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Debounce search input to reduce API calls
- Cache category list for filter dropdown

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1: Problem Proposal System ✅ (provides problems to display)
- Authentication system ✅ (for voting functionality)
- Database schema ✅ (problems, categories, votes tables)
- Navigation structure ✅ (/problems route already defined)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Problems list page displays all problems with proper layout
- [ ] All filtering options work correctly (category, status, search)
- [ ] Sorting functionality implemented for all specified criteria
- [ ] Pagination works with proper page controls and metadata
- [ ] Quick voting from cards updates vote counts in real-time
- [ ] All empty states and loading states properly handled
- [ ] Responsive design works across all device sizes
- [ ] URL parameters preserve filter/sort state for bookmarking
- [ ] Performance is optimal with large numbers of problems
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and TypeScript standards

## Notes
- This story implements the primary discovery mechanism for the platform
- Success directly impacts user engagement and community growth
- Filter state should be preserved in URL for sharing filtered views
- Consider implementing infinite scroll as future enhancement
- Quick vote functionality prepares ground for Story 2.3 voting system
